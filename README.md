<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

I’m Jody Clark</h1>

👨‍💻About Me
I’m a web developer with a passion for building user-friendly, dynamic applications. Before tech, I spent 15 years as a registered nurse, honing skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork.

In 2024, I completed the LearningFuze bootcamp, gaining a solid foundation in full-stack development. While I enjoy working across the stack, I’m most excited by front-end development, where I focus on designing smooth, intuitive user experiences.

I'm seeking full-time remote roles or opportunities in the metro Atlanta area to collaborate, grow, and contribute meaningfully. 🚀
