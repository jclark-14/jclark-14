<h1 align="center">Hi there, Im Jody 👋</h1>

<h3 align="center">💻 Full-Stack Web Developer  | 🩺 Former Registered Nurse in Atlanta, GA!</h3>

<h4>👨‍💻 About Me</h4>
I’m a web developer with a love for building user-friendly, dynamic applications. Before tech, I spent 15 years as a registered nurse, honing skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork.

In 2024, I completed the LearningFuze bootcamp, gaining a solid foundation in full-stack development. While I enjoy working across the stack, I’m most excited by front-end development, where I focus on designing smooth, intuitive user experiences.

I'm seeking full-time remote roles or opportunities in the metro Atlanta area to collaborate, grow, and contribute meaningfully. 🚀
