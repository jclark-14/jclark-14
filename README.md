<h3 align="center">💻 Full-Stack Web Developer  | 🩺 Former Registered Nurse in Atlanta, GA!</h3>

👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a web developer with a love for building user-friendly, dynamic applications. Before tech, I spent 15 years as a registered nurse, honing skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork.
I recently completed the LearningFuze bootcamp, gaining a solid foundation in full-stack development. While I enjoy working across the stack, I'm most excited by front-end development, where I focus on designing smooth, intuitive user experiences.
I'm seeking full-time remote roles or opportunities in the metro Atlanta area to collaborate, grow, and contribute meaningfully. 🚀
